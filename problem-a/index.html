    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Michael Corleone is the main protagonist of Mario Puzo's 1969 novel,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_(novel)"><i>The Godfather</i></a>.
        Unlike his two older brothers, Michael renounces the Corleone "family business",
        wanting instead to lead a more Americanized life. He is a person with a strong will.
        Generally, he is humble, respectful and occasionally shows his domineering.
        Having received higher education and once worked in the army, He originally wanted to
        become a high-ranking government official such as governor or senator instead of inheriting
        the family’s gang business. However, because of the attempted assassination of his father
        by a hostile force and the killing of his elder brother, he accepted his father’s concession,
        becoming the godfather.
